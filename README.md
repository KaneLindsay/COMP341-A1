# COMP341-A1
Project assignment for Grasp Detection

Project for the module 'COMP341 - Robot Perception and Manpulation' at the University of Liverpool.
This project demonstrates various neural network implementations for detecting the positions from which a robotic end-effector could pick up an object.
We use the notation [x, y, t, h, w] to define a grasp, where:
x: x-coordinate of grasp centre.
y: y-coordinate of grasp centre.
t: angle of rotation.
h: height of grasp area bounding box.
w: width of grasp area bounding box.

This project uses PyTorch for building neural networks, so please install this before running.
